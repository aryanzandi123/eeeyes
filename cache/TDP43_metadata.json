        "effect": "This cleavage generates several C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of TDP-43, most notably a ~25 kDa fragment. These CTFs lack the nuclear localization signal, are highly prone to aggregation, and are a major component of the pathological inclusions found in patient neurons, representing a key step in TDP-43 pathology.; TDP-43 enhances the promoter activity and mRNA expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, while decreasing the mRNA and protein levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. This shift in the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins promotes the activation of the apoptotic cascade.",
