        "mechanism": "ATXN3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. This regulation is independent of ATXN3's deubiquitinase activity on the PTEN protein itself. ATXN3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that has been identified as a regulator of PTEN, capable of removing ubiquitin chains from the PTEN protein.",
        "effect": "By repressing PTEN transcription, ATXN3 reduces PTEN mRNA and protein levels, which contributes to the hyperactivation of the oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.; By deubiquitinating PTEN, ATXN3 can reverse ubiquitination-mediated regulation, potentially affecting PTEN's stability, localization, and tumor suppressor function.",
