In Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the expanded CAG-repeat RNA transcribed from the mutant ATXN3 gene forms toxic hairpin structures. These structures sequester MBNL1 into nuclear foci, leading to a loss-of-function of MBNL1 and subsequent misregulation of alternative splicing, a phenomenon known as spliceopathy.",
