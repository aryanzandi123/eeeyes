It achieves this by recruiting a corepressor complex, which includes HDAC3 and NCoR, to the MMP-2 promoter. This leads to histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, thereby inhibiting transcription. In Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3, the expanded form of ATXN3 loses this ability, leading to aberrant MMP-2 expression.",
