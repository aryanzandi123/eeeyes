  "support_summary": "ATXN3 has a dual role in regulating the tumor suppressor PTEN. Primarily, it acts as a transcriptional repressor, reducing PTEN mRNA levels and thereby promoting PI3K/Akt signaling in certain cancers. Additionally, some evidence suggests ATXN3 can act as a deubiquitinase for PTEN, although this function is less characterized than its transcriptional role.",
