This phosphorylation event prevents TFEB's nuclear translocation, effectively retaining it in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This kinase-substrate interaction is a central mechanism for regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy in response to nutrient availability.",
