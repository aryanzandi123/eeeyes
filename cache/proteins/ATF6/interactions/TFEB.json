This occurs indirectly; in stressed cancer cells, ATF6 activity is required to sustain lysosomal function. Inhibition of ATF6 leads to the activation of mTOR, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits TFEB, leading to its downregulation. Therefore, ATF6 supports TFEB function by suppressing its inhibitor, mTOR.",
