  "mechanism": "SFPQ is a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in splicing and transcription. It interacts with TDP-43, suggesting they are part of shared nuclear protein complexes that regulate gene expression. TDP-43 binds to the NEAT1 pre-lncRNA and promotes its polyadenylation to produce the short isoform (NEAT1_1), which does not scaffold paraspeckles. SFPQ is a core component of these nuclear bodies.",
  "effect": "The interaction between TDP-43 and SFPQ points to a cooperative role in RNA metabolism. Both proteins are components of paraspeckles and are involved in maintaining neuronal integrity. The loss of this interaction due to TDP-43 mislocalization could disrupt these functions.; By promoting the short NEAT1_1 isoform, TDP-43 effectively represses the formation of paraspeckles. Loss of nuclear TDP-43 function shifts the balance towards the long, scaffolding NEAT1_2 isoform, leading to hyper-assembly of paraspeckles, which then sequester other RNA-binding proteins, including SFPQ and TDP-43 itself.",
