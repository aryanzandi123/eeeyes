  "reasoning": "The current annotation's 'activates' arrow implies TFEB enzymatically modifies YY1. The supporting evidence consistently describes YY1 as a 'co-transcription factor' that 'cooperates' with TFEB. This indicates they form a functional complex at gene promoters to activate transcription, rather than TFEB activating YY1 directly. 'complex' more accurately describes this cooperative binding and recruitment mechanism.",
